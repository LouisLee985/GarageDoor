# Example

```json
{
  "a": [{
    "t": 55,
    "s": 5,
    "es":[{
      "i": 1,
      "1": { "m": [ [ -1, 4 ] ] }
    }]
  }]
}
```

This is an example of a security system (`"t": 55`) with a switch used
to trigger alarm when security system is activated. If you want to use a hidden
switch not visible in Apple Home App, add `"h":2` to switch service.

# Modes

| Key | Default | Description |
|:------:|:------|:------------|
| "n" | [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ] | **(_default_)**

Standard HomeKit Security System has 4 modes (Descriptions by @Unteins):
- `0` At Home. People at home, ignore some sensors like your front door sensor and your motion sensors because youâ€™re coming and going through the house
- `1` Away from Home. No one at home, listen to ALL the sensors and sound alarms.
- `2` Night. everyone should be inside, ignore motion sensors in the house because we might get a glass of water in the middle of the night but all door and window sensors should trigger alarms because no one should be going on and out.
- `3` Off.

You can override those modes and select your own combination declaring `"n":[...]` array with modes that you want. For example, to have only 2 states: `"n":[1,3]`

IMPORTANT: Order must be from lower to higher.

Some modes combinations could not work in HomeKit.
