<p align="center"><img width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RavenSystem/ravensystem-media/master/works-with-apple-home.svg"></p>

Add native HomeKit support, OTA updates and a lot of custom settings to any device
with an [ESP32, ESP32-S, ESP32-C or ESP8266 microcontroller series](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules).

This means that servers like Home Assistant or bridges like HomeBridge are not necessary. This work is focused on any device that uses a compatible chip, like Sonoff, 
Shelly, and custom devices. Any suggestion is welcome, but only official Apple
HomeKit characteristics will be considered (Those that work with stock Apple
Home App), and custom HomeKit characteristics that use third-party Apps will
be rejected.

In addition to this firmware, you can obtain [**HAA Home Manager**](haa-home-manager), the perfect App companion
to manage your HAA devices, with batch updates, enable setup mode, and other extra features:
